# c#

## status
This version is halfway complete.  It basically lacks an optimization routine, but is otherwise complete.

## summary
This is the modern implementation of MoRPE.

My plan is to keep the C# version in sync with other modern versions.  Unlike the other versions, this version will contain support for visualization.
